# IRONLINKS

Hi! Ironlinks is a website that allows you to read and share links that you find useful for your web development career. From tutorials to cheat sheets and anything in between. Students often ask about links that got lost in Slack or other communication channels It is meant for the the Web dev-126 squad, but is open for everyone.

## Contribution

The application is not 100% polished and in terms of ux/ui there are still some stuff missing. Feel free to reach out to the creator or create pull requests to improve the application. Let's make it as easy and understandable to use for everyone

### TODO

- Styling in general
- Minor bug fixes when creating new links
- Search function with filter
- Deployment
- Let user set their own title?
- Takedown of signing up new accounts after one week?
